### Useful resources

- [CSS only solution to :hover on touchscreens](https://medium.com/@mezoistvan/finally-a-css-only-solution-to-hover-on-touchscreens-c498af39c31c) - This helped me to remove hover effects on mobile devices. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [20+ Amazing Pure CSS Accordions](https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/css-accordion/) - It was not used in this project, but has a lot of good ideas for Accordions.
